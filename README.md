## Reflection Questions
_1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here._

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5836833/create-an-array-with-random-values

_2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)_ 

I would say that the biggest challenge for me, overall, was having to teach myself how to implement Javascript on the fly. 
Specifically, implementing the random pattern upon new game was the most challenging aspect of this prework.
I had very little experience using it prior to this prework, but using intuition and my base knowledge of Python, I was able to carry over the concepts of variables, iteration, and for loops.
All that was needed was a bit of a recap of Javascript syntax, and a bit of guidance from the links listed above in Question 1. All in all, this was a very fun project to work on!

_3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)_ 

The first question that comes to mind is, how ubiquitous is Javascript in web development? Knowing how long it has been around, I am wondering if we are seeing a shift towards another language soon.
Another question is, how common is the use of frameworks like Flask and Django in the field of web development, specifically in private businesses? 
Lastly, besides acquiring a stronger understanding of Javascript, what other languages, frameworks, or concepts would you recommend someone to learn who is new to web development?

_4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)_ 

First, I would take a more thorough crack at implementing the final four *optional* features into my memory game. Then, I would work on revamping the look of the entire page through HTML and CSS tweaking.
I would try to give it a skin that better complements the Dracula color scheme I implemented. I would also love to program the Dracula Theme Song play whenever the game is started.
